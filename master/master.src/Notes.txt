i2c_user.vhd functionality:

Sends W Address, Sends Command (writing), continues until byteSel hits max

Sends R Address, Receives data until Write command is changed

When write command is changed, then it repeats this process, otherwise it stays reading constantly



i2c_user_write_read_repeat.vhd functionality:

Constantly Writes then reads, repeat
